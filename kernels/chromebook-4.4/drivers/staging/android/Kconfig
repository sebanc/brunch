	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	---help---
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

	depends on ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	default n
        ---help---
	  Unlike generic gpio is to allow programs to access and manipulate gpio
	  registers from user space, timed output/gpio is a system to allow changing
	  a gpio pin and restore it automatically after a specified timeout.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kills according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_AUTODETECT_OOM_ADJ_VALUES
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: detect oom_adj values"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default y
	---help---
	  Detect oom_adj values written to
	  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and convert them
	  to oom_score_adj values.
