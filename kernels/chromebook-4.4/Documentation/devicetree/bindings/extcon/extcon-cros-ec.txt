ChromeOS EC Type-C Extcon device

On CrOS systems with USB Type C ports, the ChromeOS Embedded Controller is
able to detect the state of external accessories such as display adapters
or USB devices when said accessories are attached or detatched.

The node for this device must be under a cros-ec node like google,cros-ec-spi
or google,cros-ec-i2c.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "google,extcon-cros-ec".
- google,usb-port-id:	Specifies the USB port ID to use.

Example:
	cros-ec@0 {
		compatible = "google,cros-ec-i2c";

		...

		extcon {
			compatible = "google,extcon-cros-ec";
			google,usb-port-id = <0>;
		};
	}
