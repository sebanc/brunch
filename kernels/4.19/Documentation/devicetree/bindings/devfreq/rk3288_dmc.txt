Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-dmc", "syscon"
- rockchip,cru: this driver should access cru regs, so need get cru here

      arm_clk: for get arm frequency
- logic-supply: this driver should adjust VDD_LOGIC according to dmc frequency,
                so need get logic-supply here
- rockchip,odt-disable-freq: if ddr clock frequency low than odt-disable-freq,
                             this driver should disable DDR ODT
- rockchip,dll-disable-freq: if ddr clock frequency low than dll-disable-freq,
                             this driver should disable DDR DLL
- rockchip,sr-enable-freq: if ddr clock frequency high than sr-enable-freq,
                           this driver should enable the automatic self refresh
                           function
- rockchip,pd-enable-freq: if ddr clock frequency high than pd-enable-freq,
                           this driver should enable the automatic power down
                           function
- rockchip,auto-self-refresh-cnt: Self Refresh idle period. Memories are placed
                                  into Self-Refresh mode if the NIF is idle in
                                  Access state for:
                                     auto-self-refresh-cnt * 32 * n_clk cycles
                                  The automatic self refresh function is
                                  disabled when auto-self-refresh-cnt=0.
- rockchip,auto-power-down-cnt: Power-down idle period. Memories are placed
                                into power-down mode if the NIF is idle for
                                auto-power-down-cnt n_clk cycles. The
                                automatic power down function is disabled
                                when auto-power-down-cnt=0.
- rockchip,ddr-speed-bin: DDR3 type, AC timing parameters from the memory
                          data-sheet
        0.DDR3_800D (5-5-5)

      rockchip,trcd: tRCD,AC timing parameters from the memory data-sheet
      rockchip,trp: tRP,AC timing parameters from the memory data-sheet

Optional properties:
- rockchip,dmc-disable-freq: set ddr frequency to dmc-disable-freq when
  disable dmc
- #cooling-cells = <2>: to allow ddr frequency to help cool the device
  the two cells will be min and max.

Required sub-nodes:
- operating-points
