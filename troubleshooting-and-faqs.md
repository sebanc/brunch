# Common Issues
  
  ***
<!-- This *** line creates a divider so that the dropdown looks nice.

  ### The instructions are too difficult to follow!
* ChromeOS is based on linux, most troubleshooting will require some familiarity with basic linux commands. It is strongly suggested that users are comfortable with linux before attempting an installation. If you are strugging with a specific step or would like to suggest changes to the guide, please reach out to our communities for assistance.

  ### I followed a video tutorial, now I'm having issues.
  * Video guides are very frequently out of date or use potentially dangerous scripts. For the most up to date information and guides, be sure to read over this github page thouroughly *before* asking for help. 
  
  ### My computer will not boot a Brunch USB, and I've followed all of the instructions correctly!
  * Some devices (notably Surface Go) will not boot a valid USB flash drive / SD card with secure boot on even if the shim binary is signed. For those devices, you will need to disable secure boot in your bios settings and use the legacy EFI bootloader by adding the `-l` parameter when running the chromeos-install.sh script. Other devices require using the MBR script (linked in the install instructions) Check your device to see if one of these may be needed.
  
  ###  The first boot and the ones after a framework change or an update are incredibly long! 
  * Unfortunately, the Brunch framework has to rebuild itself by copying the original rootfs, modules and firmware files after each significant change. The time this process takes depends mostly on your USB flash drive / SD card write speed. You may try with one that has better write speed or use the dual boot method to install it on your HDD.

  ### ChromeOS reboots randomly!
  * This can in theory be due to a lot of things. However, the most likely reason is that your USB flash drive / SD card is too slow. You may try with one that has better write speed or use the dual boot method to install it on your HDD.

  ### Some apps, like Netflix, do not appear on the playstore or don't run properly!
  * In order to have access to the ChromeOS shell, ChromeOS is started in developer mode by default. If you have a stable enough system, you can manually remove `cros_debug` from grub.cfg on the 12th partiton and then do a Powerwash (ChromeOS mechanism which will wipe all your data partition) to disable developer mode. This will remove access to the Crosh shell and certain other features though.
  
  ### Some android apps on the Playstore show as incompatible with my device!
  * Some Playstore apps are not compatible with genuine Chromebooks so this is probably normal. ChromeOS is not Android, so some apps and games are not optimized or avaliable.
  
  ### A new update is avaliable, is it safe to update?
  * ChromeOS updates can be unpredictable, especially on Brunch devices. Even if it's declaired safe by other users, you should *always* have backups ready in case there is an issue while updating or if the update has serious bugs on your hardware. 
  
  ### My Touchpad, Touchscreen, Wifi or other hardware is not working properly!
  * ChromeOS is not optimized for every device. Brunch has several avaliable framework options and multiple customized kernels avaliable further down on this page to help with these issues. If you're still having issues, you can reach out to other users on one of our communities for help.

## How to Use

<details>
<summary> Click for Screenshots and Instructions </summary>

***

The Brunch Configuration Menu can be accessed directly from Grub using the "ChromeOS (settings)" boot option or while logged into ChromeOS using the `sudo edit-brunch-config` command in the crosh shell.
  * To access the crosh shell, press **Ctrl + Alt + T** and type `shell` at the invite.
![Crosh][bcm-crosh]
  
 Once you've entered the Brunch Configuration Menu you will be greeted by several pages of options.
  * Use the arrow keys to move the cursor up or down.
  * Use the spacebar to select an option.
    * An empty set [ ] means the option is *not* selected.
    * A filled set [x] means the option *has* been selected.
  * When you're ready to continue, press the Enter key.
    * You won't be able to go back, but this menu can be opened again later.
    * You *do not* need to select something from every page.

## Kernels
  
<details>
<summary> Click to learn about kernels </summary>
  
*** 

Brunch has several precompiled kernels avaliable for users, you can select one from the Brunch Configuration Menu by highlighting the kernel you want, then pressing enter. If you are unsure which to choose, 5.4 is the default kernel for Brunch. Continue scrolling for more information about each avaliable option.

WARNING: Changing kernel can prevent you from logging into your ChromeOS account, in which case a powerwash is the only solution (**Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R** at the login screen). Therefore, before switching to a different kernel, make sure you have a backup of all your data. 
![Kernels][bcm-kernel]
  
Several kernels can be enabled throught the configuration menu:
- kernel 5.4: Default kernel which is considered to be the most stable.
- kernel 5.10: Most recent kernel, needed for Intel Gen 10+ and AMD Ryzen Gen 4+ devices.
- kernel 4.19: Previous brunch kernel.
- kernel chromebook-5.4: Kernel with the best support for chromebooks.
- kernel chromebook-4.4: Kernel compatible with some older chromebooks models.
- kernel macbook: 5.10 kernel with specific patches for different generations of macbooks

 </details>
 

## Kernel command line parameters
  
<details>
<summary> Click to learn about kernel line parameters </summary>
  
*** 

These are optional parameters that are not needed by every user. Some commonly used options are selectable, and more can be input manually. If you do not need any command line parameters, you can just press Enter to skip these sections.
![Command Line Paramters][bcm-cmd1]
![Custom Parameters][bcm-cmd2]
  
The most common kernel command line parameters are listed below:
- "enforce_hyperthreading=1": improve performance by disabling a ChromeOS security feature and forcing hyperthreading everywhere (even in crositini).

## Verbose Mode

<details>
  <summary> Click to learn about Verbose Mode </summary>
