# USB installations
This guide is for installing Brunch to a USB (or other disk) using Linux. This guide should be compatible with Linux Live USBs for quick installations as well. To begin, boot into the Linux distro of your choice and click the dropdown below to continue.

<details>
  <summary>Click to open Brunch USB guide</summary>

### Requirements
- Root access.
- Target Disk/USB must be 16gb minimum.
- `pv`, `tar`, `unzip` and `cgpt` packages.
- A [compatible PC][compatibility] to boot Brunch on.
- An entry level understanding of the linux terminal.
  - This guide aims to make this process as easy as possible, but knowing the basics is expected.

### Recoveries
1. Download a recovery suitable for your CPU. The list below can help you select one. You do *not* need to select a recovery that matches the latest Brunch release number, the most recent avaliable is typically fine.
  
#### Intel
* ["rammus" is suggested for 2nd gen -> 9th gen.][recovery-rammus]
* ["volteer" is suggested for 10th & 11th gen.][recovery-volteer]
  * [11th gen (and some 10th gen) may need kernel 5.10][changing-kernels] 
#### AMD
* ["grunt" is suggested for Stoney Ridge & Bristol Ridge.][recovery-grunt]
* ["zork" is suggested for Ryzen.][recovery-zork]
  * [Ryzen 4xxx devices need kernel 5.10][changing-kernels]

Recoveries can be found by clicking the above links. They can also be found by going to [cros.tech][cros-tech] and searching for the recovery you want.

After selecting the recovery you want, you can select a specific release. Posted releases may be behind the current release, this is normal and you can update into the current release later. It is usually suggested to use the latest release avaliable.

### Gathering Files
2. Download the Brunch files from this GitHub repository. Do not use files found on other sites or linked in videos online. The [releases tab][releases-tab] can be found at the bottom of the right-hand column on the main GitHub page, but it is generally suggested to use the [latest release][latest-release].

When downloading a release, select the brunch...tar.gz file from the assets at the bottom of the release post. You do not need the source code files, do not download them.

### Prepare the Terminal
3. Once both files have been downloaded, the Brunch release and your chosen ChromeOS recovery, open a terminal. In most Linux distros you can just press **ctrl + alt + t** to open it quickly.
4. Make sure that pv, cgpt, tar and unzip are installed.

```sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install pv cgpt tar unzip```
  
  * My example uses `apt`, a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu based distros. If you use Arch, you will need [vboot-utils][vboot-utils] for access to cgpt and a different package manager may be needed to install the rest.

4b. Some Linux releases may require the `universe` repo to install some of the above dependencies. If you get any errors about a dependency being unavaliable, add the `universe` repo with this command, and then try the previous step again afterwards.

```sudo add-apt-repository universe```
  
5. After all dependencies have been installed, `cd` into the directory where your files were downloaded. For most users this will be `~/Downloads`

```cd ~/Downloads```
  
6. Extract the Brunch archive using `tar`
  * Replace `brunch_filename.tar.gz` with the file's actual filename.

```tar zxvf brunch_filename.tar.gz```
  
7. Extract the ChromeOS recovery using `unzip`
  * Replace `chromeos_filename.bin.zip` with the file's actual filename.

```unzip chromeos_filename.bin.zip```

Once completed, you will have 4 new files from the brunch archive, and a recovery bin that we will use in the next step.


### Special instructions for Legacy devices **only**
This step is only needed for legacy boot devices that do not support UEFI. If your PC supports UEFI, _skip this step!_
* If you need it, this is when you should download the [MBR patch][mbr-patch] from the main branch and extract it with `tar`.
  * This file will overwrite some of the files you've already extracted, this is supposed to happen.

```tar zxvf mbr_support.tar.gz```


### Selecting a Target Disk
8. Before continuing, you will need to know what disk you want to install to. Be absolutely sure **before** you continue, this installation will erase **everything** on that disk, including other partitions. The disk must be at least 16 GB, or the installation will fail. There are several ways to determine which disk is your target, in my example I'll be using `lsblk`.

```lsblk -e7```

This command will show your disks, and the partitions on them. It will also show their sizes and if they are currently mounted. Use this information to determine which disk is your target.

***

#### Tips:
  * Your target will **never** be zram or a loop device.
  * Some PCs may require RAID to be disabled before showing your disks correctly.
  * For this installation, a USB is treated the same as any HDD or SSD.
  * If there is an EFI mountpoint on a disk that disk is your boot disk.
    * You **cannot** install Brunch directly onto the same disk you are currently booting from.
  * When doing a singleboot installation, your target will **not** be a partition. This method installs to the *entire* disk.

### Install Brunch

9. Once you've determined your target disk, you're ready to install Brunch.
  * As before, replace `chromeos_filename.bin` with the bin file's actual filename.
  * You will also replace `disk` with your target disk. (Such as `sdb`, `mmcblk0` or `nvme0n1` for example)

```sudo bash chromeos-install.sh -src chromeos_filename.bin -dst /dev/disk```

The script will ask for confirmation. If you're ready to install, type `yes` into the prompt.

The installation may take some time depending on the speed of your target disk, please be patient. There may be a couple of GPT Header errors, which can be safely ignored. Depending on the Linux distro you are doing, the system may automatically mount some of the new partitions the script made. You can safely close these windows.

The installation will report that ChromeOS was installed when it is finished. Before closing the terminal, make sure that there are no additional errors in the terminal. If there are no errors, then you are good to go!

### Next Steps
If you installed using a Linux Live USB or installed to a second internal disk, then you should be ready to boot into Brunch without a USB. If you've installed to a USB, keep it plugged in and reboot. It is normal for the first boot to take a very long time, please be patient.

* The first boot is the best time to setup anything important such as [changing kernels][changing-kernels] or [framework options][framework-options] by selecting the "ChromeOS (Settings)" boot option.
* If you have any issues, it is strongly advised to check out the [Brunch Configuration Menu][edit-brunch-config] for possible patches or solutions.

  - This guide aims to make this process as easy as possible, but knowing the basics is expected.

### Selecting a Target Disk
  
1. Log into ChromeOS, and open a Crosh Shell with **Ctrl + Alt + T**, then enter `shell` at the prompt.
  
2. Before continuing, you will need to know what disk you want to install to. Be absolutely sure **before** you continue, this installation will erase **everything** on that disk, including other partitions. The disk must be at least 16 GB, or the installation will fail.

# Dualboot installations
This guide is for installing Brunch to a partition using Linux. This guide is *not* compatible with Linux Live USBs, you should be using an already installed distro. To begin, boot into the Linux distro of your choice and click the dropdown below to continue.

<details>
  <summary>Click to open dualboot guide</summary>

### Requirements
- Root access.
- Target partition must be 16gb minimum, unencrypted, and formatted as NTFS or EXT4
- `pv`, `tar`, `unzip` and `cgpt` packages.
- A [compatible PC][compatibility] to boot Brunch on.
- An entry level understanding of the linux terminal.
  - This guide aims to make this process as easy as possible, but knowing the basics is expected.
- Grub2 Bootloader

### Recoveries
1. Download a recovery suitable for your CPU. The list below can help you select one. You do *not* need to select a recovery that matches the latest Brunch release number, the most recent avaliable is typically fine.
  
#### Intel
* ["rammus" is suggested for 1st gen -> 9th gen.][recovery-rammus]

  * Replace `brunch_filename.tar.gz` with the file's actual filename.

```tar zxvf brunch_filename.tar.gz```
  
7. Extract the ChromeOS recovery using `unzip`
  * Replace `chromeos_filename.bin.zip` with the file's actual filename.

```unzip chromeos_filename.bin.zip```

Once completed, you will have 4 new files from the brunch archive, and a recovery bin that we will use in the next step.

### Selecting a Target Partition
8. Before continuing, you will need to know what partition you want to install to. The partition must be at least 16 GB, or the installation will fail. There are several ways to determine which partition is your target, in my example I'll be using `lsblk`.

```lsblk -e7```

This command will show your disks, and the partitions on them. It will also show their sizes and if they are currently mounted. Use this information to determine which partition is your target.

***

#### Tips:
* Your target will **never** be zram or a loop device.
* Some PCs may require RAID to be disabled before showing your disks correctly.
* If there is an EFI mountpoint on a disk that disk is your boot disk.
* When doing a dualboot installation, your target will be a partition. This method creates an img file on that partition.
* The target partition does *not* need to be on the same disk as your linux install.
* If you have not made a partition yet, *make one before continuing.*

### Mount the Partition

9. After determining your target partition, make a directory to mount it onto.

```mkdir -p ~/tmpmount```
  
10. Then mount the partition to that mountpoint.
  * Replace `part` with the partition's actual name. (Such as `sda3`, `mmcblk0p5` or `nvme0n1p4` for example)

```sudo mount /dev/part ~/tmpmount```

### Install Brunch

11. Once you've mounted your target partition, you're ready to install Brunch.
  * As before, replace `chromeos_filename.bin` with the bin file's actual filename.
  * You will also replace `size` with a whole number. (Such as `14`, `20`, or `100` for example)
    * The number must be a *minimum* of 14, but *less* than the avaliable space on your partition in GB.

```sudo bash chromeos-install.sh -src chromeos_filename.bin -dst ~/tmpmount/chromeos.img -s size```

The script will ask for confirmation. If you're ready to install, type `yes` into the prompt.

The installation may take some time depending on the speed of your target disk, please be patient. There may be a couple of GPT Header errors, which can be safely ignored. If you are told that there is not enough space to install, reduce the number at the end of your command until it fits. It is normal that the img cannot take the entire space of the partition, as some of that space is reserved by the system.

The installation will report that ChromeOS was installed when it is finished. Before continuing, make sure that there are no additional errors in the terminal. If there are no errors, then you are good to continue!

### Setting up Grub

12. Copy the Grub Boot Entries that are displayed in the terminal. (All of the text *between* the lines of asterisks `********`) There will be two of them together, you should copy both entries as they are both used by Brunch.

13. Create a copy of your existing 40_custom file.

```sudo cp /etc/grub.d/40_custom /etc/grub.d/99_brunch```
  
14. Open the `99_brunch` file in an editor. For this guide we'll be using `nano` but you can use `gedit`, `vi`, or any editor of your choice.
  * If you do not have an editor, you can install `nano` with this command: `sudo apt install nano`

```sudo nano /etc/grub.d/99_brunch```
  
15. Paste the Grub Boot Entries that you copied at the *end* of this file. These boot entries must be *after* the code that is already in this file, *do not remove the existing lines of code*.

16. Save and close this file. In `nano` you'll exit by pressing **Ctrl + X** then **Y** to save. Then press **Enter** to confirm.

17. After saving, commit the new entries to Grub.

```sudo update-grub```
  
18. At this point, you can unmount the target partition.

```sudo umount ~/tmpmount```

### Secure Boot

19. If you have secure boot enabled, you should download the [secure boot key][brunch-der] from this repo and enroll the key.

```sudo mokutil --import brunch.der```

### Next Steps
It is normal for the first boot to take a very long time, please be patient.

* The first boot is the best time to setup anything important such as [changing kernels][changing-kernels] or [framework options][framework-options] by selecting the "ChromeOS (Settings)" boot option. 
* If you have any issues, it is strongly advised to check out the [Brunch Configuration Menu][edit-brunch-config] for possible patches or solutions.

# [Troubleshooting and Support][troubleshooting-and-faqs]

See the full [Troubleshooting and Support][troubleshooting-and-faqs] page if you're having issues.

### Additional Tips
* If you're having trouble booting a Brunch USB, make sure that UEFI is enabled in the BIOS (Unless you are using the MBR patch)
* Some PCs require a key to be held when booting to boot from USB or that USB booting is enabled in the BIOS
* The first boot can take up to an hour on some hardware. Brunch does not typically freeze on the Brunch logo. If you are seeing the Brunch logo, the system is _probably_ still booting.
* If your PC is stuck on the ChromeOS logo (White background), it is likely that you've got an incompatible dedicated GPU.
* If you get a blue screen saying "Verification failed" you can either disable secure boot in your bios settings, or [enroll the secure boot key][secure-boot].
  * To enroll the key directly from a USB, select OK -> Enroll key from disk -> EFI-SYSTEM -> brunch.der -> Continue and reboot.
* If the system reboots _itself_ when booting normally, then Brunch has run into an error and you may need to do some advanced troubleshooting.
