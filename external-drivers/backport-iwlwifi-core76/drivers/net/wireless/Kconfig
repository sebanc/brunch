	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an Aviator/Raytheon PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.
	  Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/wifi/ray_cs.rst> for
	  details.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called ray_cs.  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  A driver for WL3501 PCMCIA 802.11 wireless cards made by Planet.
	  It has basic support for Linux wireless extensions and initial
	  micro support for ethtool.

	depends on !KERNEL_4_12
	help
	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test
	  IEEE 802.11 networking stack (mac80211) functionality. This is not
	  needed for normal wireless LAN usage and is only for testing. See
	  Documentation/networking/mac80211_hwsim for more information on how
	  to use this tool.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mac80211_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  This is a driver for wireless RNDIS devices.
	  These are USB based adapters found in devices such as:

	  Buffalo WLI-U2-KG125S
	  U.S. Robotics USR5421
	  Belkin F5D7051
	  Linksys WUSB54GSv2
	  Linksys WUSB54GSC
	  Asus WL169gE
	  Eminent EM4045
	  BT Voyager 1055
	  Linksys WUSB54GSv1
	  U.S. Robotics USR5420
	  BUFFALO WLI-USB-G54

	  All of these devices are based on Broadcom 4320 chip which is the
	  only wireless RNDIS chip known to date.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called rndis_wlan.

config VIRT_WIFI

	depends on m
	depends on CFG80211
	help
	  This option adds support for ethernet connections to appear as if they
	  are wifi connections through a special rtnetlink device.
